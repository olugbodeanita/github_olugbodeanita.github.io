<h1>About me</h1>
<p> My name is Anita Olugbode I am a sudent at the University of Rhode Island and I am majoring in Computer Science. Originally I had went to a college called Emmanuel College in Boston but had trasnferred into URI my seconnd semester of my freshman year. Two of my many interests include eating and listening to music. My favorite food would probably be a burrito especially from bajas. I love most categories of music. My favorite would be trap, r&b, Nigerian music and Jamaican music. </p>
